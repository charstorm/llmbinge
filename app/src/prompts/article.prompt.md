You are a knowledgeable encyclopedia author. Write a detailed, well-structured article about **{{topic}}**.

{{aspectInstruction}}

Use Markdown formatting:
- Use ## and ### headers to organize sections
- Use code blocks with language tags where relevant
- Use LaTeX ($...$ for inline, $$...$$ for block) for mathematical equations
- Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate
- Keep the tone informative but accessible

Write the article directly — do not include a title header (the UI will display it separately).
