Starting from the seed topic "{{topic}}", brainstorm 100 related but diverse topics that form a rich knowledge landscape around it.

Start with closely related topics, then gradually expand outward to more distant but still connected ideas. Number each topic.

Be creative — include surprising connections, cross-disciplinary links, and niche subtopics.
