Think of 100 diverse, interesting topics spanning all fields of knowledge — science, history, art, technology, philosophy, nature, culture, mathematics, and more.

Let your mind wander freely. Be creative and surprising. Include obscure, niche, and unexpected topics alongside well-known ones. Number each topic.

Start broad, then get increasingly specific and unusual as you go.
