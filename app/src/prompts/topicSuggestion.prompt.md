Given the topic "{{topic}}", suggest 10 related topics that a curious reader might want to explore next.

These starter topics are always available to the user: {{starterTopics}}

Do NOT repeat any of those starter topics. Instead, suggest specific, interesting topics that are directly related to "{{topic}}".

Output each topic on its own line as a numbered list (e.g., "1. Topic name"). Output only the list, nothing else.
